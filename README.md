## 💡 Development Philosophy

### On Code Quality
> "Enterprise-grade code isn't just about functionality—it's about maintainability, scalability, and readability. Every line should make sense to the developer six months from now."

### On AI in Development
> "AI tools like Claude Code and Windsurf aren't replacing developers—they're amplifying what we can achieve. I've increased my productivity by 40% while maintaining code quality standards."

### On WordPress Integrations
> "The real magic happens at the intersection of platforms. WooCommerce + BuddyPress + LearnDash isn't just three plugins—it's a complete business ecosystem when architected correctly."

### On Performance
> "A beautiful website that loads in 5 seconds is a failure. Performance isn't optional—it's the foundation of user experience and SEO success."
